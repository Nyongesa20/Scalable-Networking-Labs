##Enterprise Networking: From First Principles

A comprehensive laboratory series documenting the end-to-end design, configuration, and securing of enterprise network infrastructures. This repository serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating proficiency in Cisco IOS, network architecture, and security best practices.


##Project Overview

The transition from a small office to a large-scale enterprise requires a deep understanding of "First Principles"—connectivity, scalability, and security. This series breaks down these complex topics into 10 progressive mini-projects, culminating in a full-scale judicial network implementation.


##Learning Path & Detailed Modules

Each folder below contains a dedicated README.md with deep-dive documentation, topology diagrams, and verification tests.

00   Layer 2 Basics               Switching logic, MAC tables, and collision domains.

01   DHCP & Addressing            Automated IP allocation and exclusion ranges.             

02   Centralized Services          Implementing DNS, HTTP, and Email server farms.          

03   Multiple LANs                 Logical segmentation using VLANs and Trunking.           

04   Dynamic Routing               OSPF/EIGRP implementation for scalable routing.          

05   Router-on-a-Stick             Inter-VLAN routing via sub-interfaces.                   

06   High Availability             First-hop redundancy using HSRP.                         

07  Access Control                 Traffic filtering with Standard & Extended ACLs.         

08  Enterprise Hardening           Port security, SSH, and management plane safety.         

09  Capstone: Mombasa Law Court    Final Integration: A complete enterprise rollout.        



##Skills Demonstrated

Core Switching: STP, VTP, EtherChannel, and VLANs.
Advanced Routing: Static routes, OSPF (Single/Multi-area), and ROAS.
Network Security: ACLs, NAT/PAT, Port-Security, and Console/VTY hardening.
Reliability: Gateway redundancy and failover testing.
Documentation: Systematic troubleshooting and verification logging.


##How to Navigate this Repository

The Documentation: Every sub-folder has its own README.md explaining the logic behind the configuration.
The Lab Files: Look for .pkt files to open the topology directly in Cisco Packet Tracer.
The Evidence: The Screenshots/ directory in each module provides visual proof of successful pings and "show" command outputs.


##The Capstone Spotlight
The Mombasa Law Court(Simulation Demo) project is the crown jewel of this repo. It integrates every skill learned to build a secure environment for a high-stakes judicial institution, featuring isolated networks for judges, public Wi-Fi, and secure server archives.
