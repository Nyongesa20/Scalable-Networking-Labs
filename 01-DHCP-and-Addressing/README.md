##Mini Project 01: DHCP and Addressing
##Objective
To eliminate manual IP configurations by introducing DHCP and understand the role of the router as a centralized IP address provider

##Topology
-A Router acting as DHCP server
-A layer2 Switch
-3PCs
-Single LAN

##Configurations summary
The router was configured with a DHCP pool to automatically assign IP addresses

##Observations
-IP addresses were automatically assigned to hosts
-Default gateway information was centrally distributed
-Network administration became simpler and scalable

##Limitations
-Some network devices require static IPs
-DHCP alone cannot generate IP consistency for shared resources

##Conclusion
This project demonstrates how DHCP is essential in growing networks and highlights the need for controlled IP assignment for infrastructure devices leading to centralized services
